Please, feel free to [open a discussion](https://github.com/2br-2b/Fdroid-repo/discussions) or contact me using the email on [my profile](https://github.com/2br-2b). I ***want*** to help! Please, let me help you set up your F-droid repository

More info (and guides I'll help lead you through) can be found on my posts on the [F-droid forum](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/host-an-fdroid-repository-on-github-gitlab/11662/8?u=2br-2b). Using the `servergitmirrors` config option lets you automatically push content to Github.
